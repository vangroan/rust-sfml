//! Access to the real-time state of the mouse.
//!
//! `mouse` provides an interface to the state of the mouse.
//!
//! This module allows users to query the mouse state at any time and directly, without having to
//! deal with a window and its events. Compared to the [`MouseMoved`], [`MouseButtonPressed`] and
//! [`MouseButtonReleased`] events, `mouse` can retrieve the state of the cursor and
//! the buttons at any time (you don't need to store and update a boolean on your side in order to
//! know if a button is pressed or released), and you always get the real state of the mouse, even
//! if it is moved, pressed or released when your window is out of focus and no event is triggered.
//!
//! [`MouseMoved`]: ::window::Event::MouseMoved
//! [`MouseButtonPressed`]: ::window::Event::MouseButtonPressed
//! [`MouseButtonReleased`]: ::window::Event::MouseButtonReleased
//!
//! # Usage example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use sfml::window::mouse;
//!
//! if mouse::Button::Left.is_pressed() {
//!     // left click
//! }
//!
//! // get global mouse position
//! let _position = mouse::desktop_position();
//!
//! // set mouse position relative to a window
//! window.set_mouse_position(Vector2i::new(100, 200));
//! ```
