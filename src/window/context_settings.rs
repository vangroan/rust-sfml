/// Structure defining the settings of the OpenGL context attached to a window.
///
/// `ContextSettings` allows to define several advanced settings of the OpenGL context attached
/// to a window.
///
/// All these settings with the exception of the compatibility flag and anti-aliasing level
/// have no impact on the regular SFML rendering (graphics module), so you may need to use
/// this structure only if you're using SFML as a windowing system for custom OpenGL rendering.
///
/// The `depth_bits` and `stencil_bits` members define the number of bits per pixel requested for
/// the (respectively) depth and stencil buffers.
///
/// `antialiasing_level` represents the requested number of multisampling levels for anti-aliasing.
///
/// `major_version` and `minor_version` define the version of the OpenGL context that you want.
/// Only versions greater or equal to 3.0 are relevant; versions lesser than 3.0 are all handled
/// the same way (i.e. you can use any version < 3.0 if you don't want an OpenGL 3 context).
///
/// When requesting a context with a version greater or equal to 3.2, you have the option of
/// specifying whether the context should follow the core or compatibility profile of
/// all newer (>= 3.2) OpenGL specifications. For versions 3.0 and 3.1 there is only the
/// core profile. By default a compatibility context is created. You only need to specify the
/// core flag if you want a core profile context to use with your own OpenGL rendering.
/// Warning: The graphics module will not function if you request a core profile context.
/// Make sure the attributes are set to Default if you want to use the graphics module.
///
/// Setting the debug attribute flag will request a context with additional debugging features
/// enabled. Depending on the system, this might be required for advanced OpenGL debugging.
/// OpenGL debugging is disabled by default.
///
/// Special Note for OS X: Apple only supports choosing between either a
/// legacy context (OpenGL 2.1) or a core context (OpenGL version depends on the
/// operating system version but is at least 3.2). Compatibility contexts are not supported.
/// Further information is available on the OpenGL Capabilities Tables page.
/// OS X also currently does not support debug contexts.
///
/// Please note that these values are only a hint. No failure will be reported if one or more
/// of these values are not supported by the system; instead, SFML will try to find the closest
/// valid match. You can then retrieve the settings that the window actually used to create
/// its context, with [`Window::settings`].
